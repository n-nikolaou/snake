Run the game by clicking /cmake-build-debug/game.exe

Use W A S D to control the snake and eat the circles that appear to lengthen the snake

Get the SDL2 package I used in the SDL2 PACKAGE

If you use CLion for compiling, use (in the toolchain setting) the Visual Studio compiler

If you want to compile, change the file address of the font I use in main.cpp and score.cpp
